# Bike-Sales-Analysis-Using-Excel-

🎯 Project Objective:

Analyze customer demographics and buying behavior to determine factors influencing bike purchases.
Use Excel to clean, analyze, and visualize data, and develop a dashboard to present actionable insights.

📁 Dataset:

Bike Buyers Dataset

Available on: Kaggle or Microsoft's sample datasets

Contains customer info: Age, Gender, Marital Status, Income, Commute Distance, Region, Education, Number of Cars, Purchased Bike (Yes/No), etc.

🧱 Step-by-Step Project Workflow:

1. 🧹 Data Cleaning (Power Query or manually):
* Remove duplicates

* Handle missing values (e.g., “NA” → blanks or proper labels)

* Normalize column names (e.g., "Purchased Bike" → "Bike_Purchase")

* Convert data types (Age, Income as numbers; Gender, Purchase as categories)

2. 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis:
   
* Use PivotTables and PivotCharts to answer questions like:

* Which age group buys the most bikes?

* Does income influence bike purchases?

* Are married people more likely to buy bikes?

* Which commute distance group buys more bikes?

Do men or women buy more bikes?

Example PivotTables:
Segment	Bike Buyers	Non-Bike Buyers
26-35 (Age group)	65%	35%
Income > $60,000	70%	30%
Commute < 5 miles	80%	20%

3. 📈 Dashboard Creation in Excel:

Create a one-page interactive Bike Sales Dashboard with:

* Slicers for filters: Gender, Region, Education

* KPIs: % of customers who bought bikes, Avg Income of buyers

Charts:

* Bar Chart: Bike Purchase by Age Group

* Pie Chart: Bike Purchase by Gender

* Column Chart: Bike Purchase by Commute Distance

* Map (if location/region present): Purchases by Region

Excel Features Used:

* Pivot Tables & Charts

* Slicers & Timeline

* Conditional Formatting

* IF statements

* COUNTIF, AVERAGEIF

* Data validation drop-downs

* Named Ranges

📌 Key Business Insights:

* Customers aged 25-40 are the most frequent buyers.
* Shorter commute distances correlate with higher likelihood of purchase.
* Higher income groups show increased interest in bike ownership.

* Single individuals tend to buy fewer bikes than married ones.

* Educational background slightly influences the purchase decision.
